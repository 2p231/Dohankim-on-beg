     Roland Barthes suggests there are three ways to finish any piece of writing: the ending will 
    have the last word or the ending will be silent or the ending will execute a pirouette,
     do something unexpectedly incongruent. Gaston Bachelard says the single most succinct 
     and astonishing thing: We begin in admiration and we end by organizing our disappointment. 
     The moment of admiration is the experience of something unfiltered, vital and fresh—it could 
     also be horror—and the moment of organization is both the onset of disappointment and its dignification;
      the least we can do is dignify our knowingness, the loss of some vitality through familiarization,
       by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, think about it. 

       I am afraid there is no way around this. It is the one try inevitable thing. And if you believe that,
        then you are conceding that in the <strong><a href="index.html" style="color: blue;">beginning</a></strong> was the act, not the word.The painter Cy Twombly quotes 
        John Crowe Ransom, on a scrap of paper: “The image cannot be disposed of a primordial freshness which 
        ideas can never claim.”Easy and appropriate thing for a painter to say. Cy Twombly uses text in some 
        of his drawings and paintings, usually poetry, usually Dante. Many men and women have written long essays 
        and lectures on the ideas they see expressed in Twombly’s work. 
         Bachelard’s sentence simply says this: origins  <strong><a href="index.html" style="color: blue;">(beginnings)</a></strong> have consequences (endings).
        The poem is the consequence of its origins. Give me the fruit and I will take from it a see and plant 
        it and watch grow the tree from which it fell. 
        Barbara Henstein Smith, in her book Poetic Closure: A Study of How Poems End, says this: 
        “Perhaps all we can say, and even this may be too much, is that varying degrees or states of tension 
        seem to be involved in all our experiences, and that the most gratifying ones are those in which whatever 
        tensions are created are also released. Or, to use another familiar set of terms, an experience
         is gratifying to the extent that those expectations that are aroused are also fulfilled.”
